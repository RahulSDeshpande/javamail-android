The goal is to provide a 100% working lightweight javamail port of the JavaMail API.

Currently tested / working :
  * IMAP commands
  * Mime messages handling

This work is based on the opensourced version of JavaMail and activation (JAF) available in the glassfish repository, and some parts of Apache Harmony's opensource implementation of AWT.

The source Code is available under same licenses as javamail which is :
  * CDDL-1.0
  * GPL-2.0
  * BSD
